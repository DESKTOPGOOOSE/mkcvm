# mkcvm-1.2.11
This is a fork of mkcvm that compiles the 1.2.11 (release/1.2.11) instead of 1.2.10, which has been unsupported since late 2021.

# Supported distros
Currently Ubuntu and Arch Linux are supported. The script will detect your distro automatically (by checking the presence of a package manager).

For now it is assumed that if you have `apt`, you are using Ubuntu, and if you have `pacman`, you are using Arch.

Warning: Might be broken.

# How to use
1. Download the file: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DESKTOPGOOOSE/mkcvm/main/mkcvm.sh`
3. Make it executable: `chmod +x mkcvm.sh`
4. Run it: `./mkcvm.sh`
